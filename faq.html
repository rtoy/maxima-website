<h4>
<span class="mw-headline">What is Maxima?</span>
</h4>
<p>Maxima is a descendant of DOE <strong>Macsyma</strong>, which had
its origins in the late 1960s at MIT. It is the only system based on
that effort still publicly available and with an active user
community, thanks to its open source nature. Macsyma was the first of
a new breed of computer algebra systems, leading the way for programs
such as Maple and Mathematica. This particular variant of Macsyma was
maintained by William Schelter from 1982 until he passed away in
2001. In 1998 he obtained permission to release the source code under
GPL. It was his efforts and skill which have made the survival of
Maxima possible, and we are very grateful to him for volunteering his
time and skill to keep the original Macsyma code alive and well. Since
his passing a group of users and developers has formed to keep Maxima
alive and kicking. Maxima itself is reasonably feature complete at
this stage, with abilities such as symbolic integration, 3D plotting,
and an ODE solver, but there is a lot of work yet to be done in terms
of bug fixing, cleanup, and documentation. This is not to say there
will be no new features, but there is much work to be done before that
stage will be reached, and for now new features are not likely to be
our focus.</p>

<span class="mw-headline">Who is maintaining Maxima now?</span>
</h4>
<p>Since William Schelter’s passing a group of users and developers
has formed to keep Maxima under active development. There are
currently 25 developers who can make changes to the source code. To
get in touch with them, the preferred channel is the <a href="maximalist.html">mailing list</a>.</p>

<span class="mw-headline">Who wrote Maxima?</span>

<p>Maxima is a descendant of <em>DOE Macsyma</em>, which had its
origins in the late 1960s at MIT. It is the only system based on that
effort still publicly available and with an active user community,
thanks to its open source nature. Macsyma was the first of a new breed
of computer algebra systems, leading the way for programs such as

Maxima possible, and we are very grateful to him for volunteering his
time and skill to keep the original Macsyma code alive and well.</p>
<a name="Macsyma" id="Macsyma">

<h4>
<span class="mw-headline">What's the difference among Macsyma, DOE-Macsyma, Symbolics Macsyma and Maxima?</span>
</h4>
<p>The system developed at MIT was called <em>Macsyma</em> (although the
nicknames MACSYM and MAXIMA were sometimes used since filenames were
limited to six uppercase-only characters in sixbit character
code).</p>
<p>Symbolics licensed Macsyma from M.I.T. and registered "Macsyma" as
a trademark at some point (presumably with M. I. T.’s permission).</p>
<p>When Macsyma source ceased to be freely available, pressure was put
on M. I. T. (mostly by Richard Fateman) to transfer the code which had
been developed largely with Department of Energy (DOE) funding to the
DOE, which then released it to others under certain conditions.</p>
<p>That codebase was called DOE Macsyma. I don’t know what legal
rights the DOE had to the name Macsyma as opposed to the codebase, but
presumably the non-commercial users of DOE Macsyma wanted to avoid any
legal wrangling around the name, and started using the name Maxima at
some point (but I don’t know when that was).</p>
<p>So the short answer as I understand it is that Maxima is simply the
most recent name for the branch that started under the name DOE
Macsyma.</p>
<a name="Citing" id="Citing">

<h4>
<span class="mw-headline">What is the appropriate way to cite Maxima in an academic context?</span>
</h4>
<p>We suggest something like:</p>
<blockquote>
<a href="http://maxima.sourceforge.net">Maxima.sourceforge.net</a>. Maxima,
a Computer Algebra System.<br />
Version 5.34.0 (2014). <tt>http://maxima.sourceforge.net/</tt>
</blockquote>
<p>(or replace the version number and release year, if you are using a
different version).</p>
<p>If you use Bibtex for your citations, we recommend that you add the following entry in your bibtex database:</p>
<pre class="example">
@ELECTRONIC{maxima,
  author = {Maxima},
  year = {2013},
  title = {Maxima, a Computer Algebra System.  Version 5.30.0},
  address = {http://maxima.sourceforge.net/},
  url = {http://maxima.sourceforge.net/},
  owner = {maxima},
  timestamp = {2013.04.03}
}

<span class="mw-headline">3. Lisp related issues</span>
</h3>
<a name="Flavors" id="Flavors">
</a>
<h4>
<span class="mw-headline">What Lisp implementations will Maxima work with?</span>
</h4>
<p>Clisp, CMUCL, Scieneer Common Lisp (SCL), GCL (ANSI-enabled only)
and SBCL can compile and execute Maxima. Allegro Common Lisp, OpenMCL
and ECL might also work, but have not been fully tested. Ports to
other ANSI lisps should be straightforward and are welcome; please
contact the developers if you are interested in working on a port.
See also the <a href="lisp.html">Lisp Implementations page</a>.</p>

<span class="mw-headline">4. Installation problems</span>
</h3>
<a name="maxima_exec" id="maxima_exec">
</a>
<h4>
<span class="mw-headline">While installing the Maxima RPM file in Linux, I get an error that "maxima_exec" is a missing dependency; how can I solve that?</span>
</h4>
<p>You must install at least two rpms, maxima and maxima_exec. Go back
to the SourceForge file manager and download a <tt>maxima-exec</tt>
package and install that at the same time as the maxima package.</p>
<a name="RPM" id="RPM">
</a>
<h4>
<span class="mw-headline">While installing RPM files file from Maxima, I get messages about failed dependencies on stuff other than maxima_exec; what does that mean?</span>
</h4>
<p>The Maxima RPMs were created on a specific Linux system. Other
systems have different versions of various libraries. To install
Maxima, the library versions must be the same.  You might be able to
find rpms for your specific Linux version via the Maxima ports page.
You can recompile Maxima on your system. The rpms created that way
have the right dependencies for your system.</p>
<p>To recompile Maxima, you need a Lisp implementation. We recommend
Clisp.  Once you have Clisp installed, download the Maxima
<tt>src.rpm</tt> from the SF file manager. Unpack it and launch
rpmbuild to create the rpm files:</p>
<pre class="example">
$ sudo rpm -ih maxima-5.9.3.src.rpm
$ cd /usr/src/local   # or wherever rpm source code is located
$ sudo rpmbuild -bb SPECS/maxima.spec
</pre>
<p>Then install the rpm files which were created in
<tt>/usr/src/local/RPMS</tt>.</p>
<p>You almost certainly need superuser privileges to write files to
<tt>/usr/src/local</tt>, hence the use of sudo. Perhaps you can get
your friendly system administrator to handle it.</p>
<p>If you create RPMs, we can host them in the Sourceforge file
manager; it would be helpful to anyone running the same Linux
flavor.</p>
<p>The installation notes in the <a href="download.html">Download</a>
section say a little bit more about rebuilding Maxima. In particular,
follow the links to <tt>README.lisps</tt> and
<tt>README.rpms</tt>.</p>

<span class="mw-headline">5. Run-time problems</span>
</h3>
<a name="Windows" id="Windows">
</a>
<h4>
<span class="mw-headline">In Windows, I can launch the Maxima GUI (either Xmaxima or WxMaxima), but then there is a timeout message and I don’t get any response when I enter some expression.</span>
</h4>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>Problem 1</strong>. <em>Blocked socket</em>. Maxima GUI
programs talk to the computational engine through a socket. Antivirus
and/or firewall programs see that and try to block it (because some
malicious programs open sockets too).</dt>
<dd>
<strong>Solution</strong>: Try to find the control panel for the
antivirus and/or firewall. Find the Maxima GUI on the list of blocked
programs and disable blocking for it. The GUI program might appear as
"Tcl/Tk" (the name of the GUI toolkit for Xmaxima).</dd>
<dt>
<strong>Problem 2</strong>. <em>Data execution prevention</em>
(DEP). Some Lisp implementations execute code in data areas of
memory. Windows DEP sees that and blocks it (because some malicious
programs execute code in data areas too).</dt>
<dd>
<strong>Solution</strong>: Include the full program path of the
Maxima executable, for example: <tt>C:\Program
Files\Maxima-5.10.0\lib\maxima\5.10.0\binary-gcl\maxima.exe</tt> in
the list of DEP exceptions (Control Panel → System → Advanced →
Performance → DEP)</dd>

<h4>
<span class="mw-headline">In Linux, I get a message about an invalid entry for localhost in <tt>/etc/hosts</tt> file</span>
</h4>
<p>Make sure there is an entry that matches: <tt>127.0.0.1
localhost</tt>, otherwise wxmaxima and/or xmaxima will be unable to
resolve "localhost" to a valid IP and then fail with "maxima
terminated".</p>
<a name="MacOS" id="MacOS">
</a>
<h4>
<span class="mw-headline">In MacOS, wxmaxima starts but every attempt to execute Maxima commands reports "Not connected to maxima!"</span>
</h4>
<p>Probably your best bet is to report this problem on the wxMaxima
user forum.  There are reports that wxMaxima does not work if Maxima
is compiled with clisp or sbcl. If you are using one of those Lisp
versions, you might want to try compiling Maxima with cmucl.</p>
