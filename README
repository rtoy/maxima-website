This is the "Website" GIT repository, which contains the Webpages of
project Maxima (http://maxima.sourceforge.net)

After committing any modifications to this repository, the Webpages
must be updated in the Sourforge Web server, by running "git pull"
in directory /home/project-web/maxima/htdocs

If you are helping maintain the Website and you use Linux, you can
simplify that update process by creating a file "update_maximaweb"
with the following content:


#!/bin/sh
USER=sourceforge_name
ssh $USER,maxima@shell.sourceforge.net create
ssh $USER,maxima@shell.sourceforge.net "cd /home/project-web/maxima/htdocs; git pull"
ssh $USER,maxima@shell.sourceforge.net shutdown


Where sourceforge_name should be replaced with your user name in
Sourceforge. Make that file executable and put it somewhere in your
executable commands path. Then run that command every time you would
like to update the Website with the current GIT repository.

If you do not want to or cannot do that update yourself, please send a
request for Website update in the Maxima mailing list.
